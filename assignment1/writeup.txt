Part 1 (Classification Part):
I tried so many things, at least 15 hours on this part and nothing really beats the easy baseline, so I'm not really sure why. the dataset seems to be 
heavily skewed towards popularity of the books. I wanted to use a deep learning model but I dont have enough knowledge for it. The best model 
I can make is still combining jaccard similiarity with popularity vote. I tried things like cosine similiarity (which worked very badly), popular 
users (users who read more books), taking logs for certain values and other ideas. I tried fitting the features with gradient boosters, and regression models
but it also didn't work well (mostly in 70% ish).

Part 2 (Rating Part):
I tried a long time on this part as well, and specically writing a latent factor model with the gamma parameters but it just doesn't work as well
Locally I get 1.41 MSE but on gradescope it goes to 1.43. I can't figure out why and also I don't know how to do cross validation so it was very 
tedious. The key point here was adding a different lambda for both the user and the book, and fine tuning them each, instead of using the same parameter

Overall this is a very hard homework and I wish there was more guidance. 

Resources used:
I edited certain code from the hw3 solution, because I realized that I made mistakes during my hw3 homework. So I didn't use exactly from my hw3 code
. I saw that it was allowed on piazza. Similiarly, I used chatgpt for debugging, and syntax purposes.
